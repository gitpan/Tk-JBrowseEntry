DESCRIPTION
    JBrowseEntry widgets allow one to specify a full combo-box, a "readonly"
    box (text field allows user to type the 1st letter of an item to search
    for, but user may only ultimately select one of the items in the list),
    or a "textonly" version (drop-down list disabled), or a completely
    disabled widget. One may also specify whether or not the button which
    activates the dropdown list via the mouse can take focus or not
    (-btntakesfocus) or whether the widget itself can take focus or is
    skipped in the focusing order. The developer can also specify the
    maximum length of the dropdown list such that if more than that number
    of items is added, a scrollbar is automatically added (-height).

    One can optionally specify a label (-label), similar to the "LabEntry"
    widget. By default, the label appears packed to the left of the widget.
    The positioning can be specified via the "-labelPack" option. For
    example, to position the label above the widget, use "-labelPack =>
    [-side => 'top']".

    This widget is similar to other combo-boxes, ie. JComboBox, but has good
    keyboard bindings and allows for quick lookup/search within the listbox.
    pressing <RETURN> in entry field displays the dropdown box with the
    first entry most closly matching whatever's in the entry field
    highlighted. <UP> and <DOWN> arrows work the listbox as well as pressing
    a key, which will move the highlight to the next item starting with that
    letter/number, etc. <UP> and <DOWN> arrows pressed within the entry
    field circle through the various list options as well. Pressing <RETURN>
    or <SPACE> in the listbox selects the highlighted entry and copies it to
    the text field and removes the listbox. <ESC> removes the listbox from
    view.  There is also a "Tab-Complete" option.

	perl ./JBrowseTest.pl
