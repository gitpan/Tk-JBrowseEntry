Revision history for "ptkftp".

4.31  Aug/2002
	- Complete redesign from older version.
	- Started recording Changes.
4.4   Fri Aug 16, 2002
	- Fixed bug where "-browsecmd" callback was called too often.
	- Fixed bug where "end" was added as a value on listboxes with no "-width" 
	  option specified when list was automatically resized.
	- Fixed problem where listbox width not automatically resized down to new
	  entry field width when it became smaller.
	- Added code to cause the dropdown button and list to be disabled whenever 
	  the list size becomes zero and reactivate whenever a choice is added to 
	  a zero-length list.
	- Fixed minor bugs with "choices" and "insert" function.
	- Added this Changes file
4.41  Sat Aug 17, 2002
	- Fixed disabled background color on entry text.
4.42
	- Added "-maxwidth" option to limit maximum width in characters the 
	  entry field will expand to.  Otherwise, it can expand as list items are 
	  added to accomodate the widest item string.
4.43  May 31, 2003
	- Added several patches by Frank Herrmann to cause the "-browsecmd" 
	  callback to be called whenever the text value changed, and some other 
	  minor tweeks.
4.44
	- Added "-listrelief" option to allow one to specify the relief of the 
	  dropdown list (defaults to "sunken" and was previously always "sunken").
	- Added "-browse" option to allow for old "-browsecmd" callback behavior 
	  so that it is only called when a selection is actually made from the 
	  dropdown list.  This was the behavior before the "Frank Herrmann" 
	  patches were added.  The default is the new behavior.  To get the old 
	  behavior, use "-browse => 1".
4.47  Thu Nov 20, 2003
	- Added "-tabcomplete" option to allow pressing the "<Tab>" key in the 
	  Entry widget to cause an incomplete string typed in to be "completed" to 
	  the next matching string in the list.  Pressing the "<Tab>" key again 
	  will transfer focus to the next widget.  To get this behavior, use 
	  "-tabcomplete => 1".  The default is the old behavior of simply tabbing 
	  to the next widget without altering the typed text.
4.48  Fri Nov 21, 2003
	- Fixed bug which caused tab-key to be "stuck" on the widget if there 
	  was nothing in the listbox.  Made "-tabcomplete" not change what 
	  user typed in if there is no match in the list.  Added 
	  "-tabcomplete => 2" to keep 4.47 behavior (force tab to change the 
	  typed value to a valid list entry or the default value).
4.49	 -not released.
4.50	 Fri Nov 28, 2003
	- Minor tweeks in relief appearance.
4.52  Tue Feb 01, 2005
	- Added "-altbinding" option to allow different keyboard binding schemata.
	- Added "-disabledbackground" and "-disabledforeground" options.
	- Fixed "-labelPack" option to work, if packed above or below main widget.
	- Fixed small glitch in listbox vertical sizing.

4.61  Mon Feb 14, 2005
	- Added hash-reference as an option for the choices so that it can work like 
	  selects in HTML where one set of values is displyed to the user (the 
	  hash values and the other (the keys) is actually returned.  Also added 
	  the functions:  dereference, dereferenceOnly, hasreference, and fetchhash 
	  to work with these.
4.63  Apr 29, 2006
	- Added option (-deleteitemsok) so that user can delete items from 
	  history list.
4.64  Sun Jul 30, 2006
	- Minor tweeks for JFileDialog.
4.65  Tue Oct 25, 2006
	- Add right-arrow completion so that if one types the first (few) letter(s) 
	  of one of the choices in the list, then presses the right-arrow (with 
	  the cursor at the end of the typed string, the text will be completed 
	  with the first matching choice in the list (similar to up and 
	  down-arrow, but repeated pressing only toggles between any 
	  matching choices in the list, whereas down-arrow, continues to 
	  switch between all the choices in the list.  To revert to pre-4.65 
	  behavior, specify -altbinding => 'Right=NoSearch'.
